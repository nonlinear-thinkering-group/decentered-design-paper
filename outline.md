* We suggest a decentralised, collaborative environment for mapping the gobal, interconnected problems called "the mess"
    * The situation is a "global mess" and we need tools to deal with it
        * Design is situated, climate change is not
            * Plans and situated actions
        * Design is intentional, side effects are not
            * Teleology v.s. Unintentional side-effects
            * Heinz von Foerster (cybernetics)
        * Design is economic, messes are ecologic
        * Halpern: Communicative Objectivity

    * Mapping is an essential part of dealing with wicked problems and messes
        * Design thinking, uses mapping as a way of "problem framing"
        * Systems thinking, too has it's notation systems including dynamo, and it's diagrams

    * The design methods movement is related heavily to computer aided design/hypertext systems
        * Rittel proposes IBIS
        * Alexander proposes a pattern language
        * Ted nelson, Intertwingluarity
        * Douglas engelbart
        * OLAP & excell sheets
        * The mangle of software development


    * The research proposes a collaborative hypertext information system
        * That allows for informal and formal input, that can evolve in time
        * That allows for multiple incompatible persectives
        * That allows for detanglement of (hairy balls of mud visualizations)
        * That is as much programming as it is sketching
        * Boundry logic

{{ `af`: main direction is to push for computational cosmogony, and use this paper to explore the larger ‘ambient space’ that CC starts from? }}

{{`mg`: yeah, I would say we move from two directions.
    We use this paper to explore the larger, more theoretical 'arguments' about why and how we want to 'meta-design' these computational tools; a kind of general vision in a sense.

    We can use the other document to go more from the other direction, discussing more the details of everyday situated practice of computational tools. In practice, we will need a kind of bootstrapping approach: building small everyday tools that will enable bigger tools that will enable us to move in the direction of this larger vision.}}
{{ `af`: very! }}
