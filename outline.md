"We have also come to realize that no problem ever exists in complete isolation. Every problem interacts with other problems and is therefore part of a set of interrelated problems, a system of problems I choose to call such a system a mess … Furthermore solutions to most problems produce other problems… a financial problem, a maintenance problem, and conflict among family members for its use."

— Russell L. Ackoff


# Introduction

The rise of a new class of anthropogenic environmental problems such as climate change has been characterised by kittler et al as "super wicked problems" [^1], an extension of the concept of "wicked problems" [^ <https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem>] first proposed by rittel et. al in ...

We argue that even this hyperbole is not enough, since climate change is not at all an isolated issue, and there are many interrelated super wicked problems including, amongst others: planetary overshoot[3], mass extinction, migrant crisis and the antibiotic resistance crisis[4]. Following Ackoff, we call this system of problems a "mess".

It seems clear to us that we are ill equipped to avoid the occurance of such issues, and that traditional approaches to 'problem solving' are failing.

The research can be seen as consisting of two parts, although they are inherently entangled.

* Firstly we attempt to define a new form of collaborative design which we call "decentered design".
* Secondly we attempt to create the technical, social (and economic?) infrastructures which will enable such a form of design to emerge.

This approach is inspired by the idea of Metadesign [^ <https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadesign>], a design approach to complexity theory and information systems that was first put forward by Andries Van Onck in 1963, but has since been adapted by different authors including "wood"

{{More recently, some efforts have been made to systematize Metadesign as a structured creative process, such as Fischer's and Giaccardi's and Caio Vassão's academic works, among several others, based on a much wider reference frame, ranging from post-structuralist philosophy, Neil Postman's media ecology, Christopher Alexander's pattern languages and deep ecology.}}

# De-centered design

Design has always been a matter of perspective. This perhaps explains the popularity of the "..-centered design" naming scheme. Since the initial proposal of the term "user-centered design" [^ <https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-centered_design>] by norman, and the subsequent emergence of "human-centered design" [^ <https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-centered_design>] there has been {{ IDEO? }}  and ..., to name a few. Particularly the notion of human-centered design, with it's positivist humanism, although extremely popular, is obviously "anthropocentric" in it's thinking. Super wicked problems will require us to deal with the fact that there are many types of subjectivity, some of which may be non-human [^ <https://tuinvanmachines.hetnieuweinstituut.nl/en/stack-and-posthuman-user-interview-benjamin-bratton>]. This is why we propose a shift away from any kind of "centrism", towards what we call decentered design.

The main properties of super wicked problems are:

* Time is running out
* No central authority.
* Those seeking to solve super wicked problems are also causing it. For example the people who advocate for reduced carbon emission, still emit carbon themselves. The causal chain is complex and situated at different levels of scale, within different types of system.
* Policies discount the future rationality

This is why:

* Decentered design requires what one could call "Ambient Perspective". Not top-down, nor bottom up. But distributed like a rhizome.

* Decentered design requires us to stop "object oriented" ways of modeling in favour of "subject orientedness”. {{ could not find any ref }}

* Decentered design requires us to stop Systems & Components ways of modeling in favour of Wholes & Holons [^ <https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holon_(philosophy)>].

* Decentered design breaks down the notion of "project-scope", and the notion of "side-effects".

* Decentered design operates on many levels of scale, time, and complexity. {{ i remember of a reference for this, will look it up }}

* Emergent properties, system boundries

* Design is situated, climate change is not
> Plans and situated actions

* Design is intentional, side effects are not
> Teleology
> Heinz fvon Foerster (cybernetics)

# Techno-social infrastructures

Rittel, in his discussion of wicked problems proposes a design method known as issue-based information system (IBIS) for handling wicked problems. An approach which he proposed be augmented with a hypertext system.

The history of hypertext is complicated, and we argue that current systems only support "weak" versions of hypertext.

We position our research in line with what one could call the "tools for thinking tradition" which includes among others, douglas engelbart and ted nelson.

Traditional approaches to visualizing complexity quickly devolve into either oversimplification, or what we could call "hairy ball of mud" visualizations, which do not provide any further insight.

We propose a multi-modal system which supports many types of congruous symbolic and diagrammatic representations of systems from many perspectives.

We propose a stigmergetic [^ <https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigmergy>] collaborative model, similar to open-source projects, or wikipedia. Which allows people to collaborate even though they might not be otherwise be inclined to do so due to economic reasons or traditional project scope.

{{ `af`: main direction is to push for computational cosmogony, and use this paper to explore the larger ‘ambient space’ that CC starts from? }}

{{`mg`: yeah, I would say we move from two directions.
    We use this paper to explore the larger, more theoretical 'arguments' about why and how we want to 'meta-design' these computational tools; a kind of general vision in a sense.

    We can use the other document to go more from the other direction, discussing more the details of everyday situated practice of computational tools. In practice, we will need a kind of bootstrapping approach: building small everyday tools that will enable bigger tools that will enable us to move in the direction of this larger vision.}}
