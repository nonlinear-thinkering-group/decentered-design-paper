# Introduction

The rise of a new class of anthropogenic environmental problems such as climate change and mass extinction has been characterised by kittler et al as "super wicked problems", an extention of the concept of "wicked problems" first proposed by rittel et. al in ...

It seems clear to us that in these cases traditional approaches to problem solving are failing, and are ill equipped to identify solutions. Furthermore we doubt if it is even appropriate to speak about solutions at all in these contexts.

The research can be seen as consisting of two parts, allthough they are inherently entangled.
* Firstly we attempt to define a new form of collaborative design which we call "decentered design".
* Secondly we attempt to create the technical, social (and economic?) infrastructures which will enable such a form of design to emerge.

This approach is inspired by the idea of Metadesign, a design approach to complexity theory and information systems that was first put forward by Andries Van Onck in 1963, but has since been adapted by different authors including "wood"

{{More recently, some efforts have been made to systematize Metadesign as a structured creative process, such as Fischer's and Giaccardi's and Caio Vass√£o's academic works, among several others, based on a much wider reference frame, ranging from post-structuralist philosophy, Neil Postman's media ecology, Christopher Alexander's pattern languages and deep ecology.}}

# De-centered design

Design has allways been a matter of perspective. This perhaps explains the popularity of the "..-centerd design" naming scheme. Since the initial proposal of the term "user-centered design" by norman, and the subsequent emergence of "human-centered design" there has been ...  and ..., to name a few. Particularly the notion of human-centered design, with it's positivist humanism, although extremely popular, is obviously "anthropocentric" in it's thinking. Super wicked problems will require us to deal with the fact that there are many types of subjectivity, some of which may be non-human. This is why we propose a shift away from any kind of "centrism", towards what we call decentered design.

The main properties of super wicked problems are
* Time is running out
* No central authority.
* Those seeking to solve super wicked problems are also causing it. For example the people who advocate for reduced carbon emssion, still emit carbon themselves. The causaul chain is complex and situated at different levels of scale, within different types of sytem.
* Policies discount the future rationality

This is why:

* Decentered design requires what one could call "Ambient Perspective". Not top-down, nor bottom up. But distributed like a rhizome.

* Decentered design requires us to stop "object oriented" ways of modeling in favour of "subject orientedness".

* Decentered design requires us to stop Systems & Components ways of modeling in favour of Wholes & Holons.

* Decentered design breaks down the notion of "project-scope", and the notion of "side-effects".

* Decentered design operates on many levels of scale, time, and complexity.

# Techno-social infrastructures

Rittel, in his discussion of wicked problems proposes a design method known as issue-based information system (IBIS) for handling wicked problems. An approach which he proposed be augmented with a hypertext system.

The history of hypertext is complicated, and we argue that current systems only support "weak" versions of hypertext.

We position our research in line with what one could call the "tools for thinking tradition" which includes among others, douglas engelbart and ted nelson.

Traditional approaches to visualizing complexity quickly devolve into either oversimplification, or what we could call "hairy ball of mud" visualizations, which do not provide any further insight.

We propose a multi-modal system which supports many types of congruous symbolic and diagrammatic representations of systems from many perspectives.

We propose a stigmergetic collaborative model, similar to open-source projects, or wikipedia. Which allows people to collaborate even though they might not be otherwise be inclined to do so due to economic reasons or traditional project scope.
