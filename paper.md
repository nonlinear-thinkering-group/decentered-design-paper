# hyper-mapping the global mess

Alltough the super wicked problem of climate change has increasingly gained attention as one of the most important issues of this generation, it is not at all an isolated issue. Climate change is surrounded by many interrelated problems including, but not limited to, planetary overshoot, mass extinction, poverty, migration, resource depletion and the antibiotic resistance crisis. The concept of a "mess" [4 Russell] describes such a system of interrelated problems, where solutions to most problems produce other problems. Following Russel, we call this non-hierarchichal system of interrelated wicked problems "the global mess".

There are different places to intervene in a system (Meadows) some of which are more powerfull than others. Policy-makers usually only focus on the least powerfull such as subsidies, taxes and standards. While responsible design offers worthy symptom management and incremental improvements such as electric cars and biofuels, rarely does design thinking intervene at the truely systemic level. Messes tend to have a "strange loop" structure, where those trying to solve the problem are also causing it (Morton), solutions to one problem, may be causing chains of other problems somewhere else. Designers are educated to function within a larger economic system (Wood) and are largely concerned with intentional action. Mess-y issues however, are allmost allways un-intentional and fall outside of economic boundries. From the systemic perpective unintended side-effects are just effects. This is why we need to re-design design at the paradigmatic level, learning to deal better with complex causal structures, intentional or not.

Our approach attempts to build on earlier efforts in the design methods movement and the development of hypertext systems. Rittel, in his proposal of IBIS(issue based information systems) as an aproach to wicked problems developed hypertext tools as a way of augmenting tedious pen-and paper processes [9]. Similarly, Alexander's "a pattern language" has the structure of a hypertext document, which later inspired the idea of the wiki [10]. Hypertext pioneer Ted Nelson has described the structure of knowledge as being 'intertwingular'[11], mirroring the interconnected, non-hierarchichal structure of messes. Douglas Engelbart developed his NLS (oNLine System), as a "strategy and means for coping with complex problems" [12]. Most of these pioneers however, argue that allthough computers have now become commonplace, their power as "tools for thinking" remains underutilised. (sources)

In this research we attempt to develop socio-technical infrastructures for building a globaly distributed, shared understanding of messy situations and the radical re-imagining of them. Both design thinking and systems thinking rely heavily on the notion of mapping. While systems-dynamics has it's more formal diagrammatic symbols, designers generally rely on more fuzzy representations. We propose a decentralised and collaborative 'systems-cartography' method, that allows a multiplicity of symbolic and diagrammatic representations to exist, transform and grow over time.
