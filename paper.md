# hyper-mapping the global mess

"We have also come to realize that no problem ever exists in complete isolation. Every problem interacts with other problems and is therefore part of a set of interrelated problems, a system of problems I choose to call such a system a mess … Furthermore solutions to most problems produce other problems… a financial problem, a maintenance problem, and conflict among family members for its use."

— Russell L. Ackoff

In this research we attempt to develop a decentralised and collaborative 'systems-cartography' tool. The purpose of this tool is to build global shared understanding of interrelated wicked problems which we call 'messes'.

The rise of a new class of anthropogenic environmental problems such as climate change has been characterised by kittler [et.al](http://et.al/) [1] as 'super wicked problems', an extension of the concept of 'wicked problems' first proposed by rittel et. al. However, climate change is not at all an isolated issue, and it is surrounded by many interrelated wicked problems including: planetary overshoot[2], mass extinction, poverty, migration, resource depletion, the antibiotic resistance crisis[3], to name but a few. Following Ackoff[4], we could call this global, interconnected system of problems 'a mess'.

While design thinking has the unique potential to address wicked problems in a solution-focused way, Wood[5] argues that: "...designers are trained to operate as subordinate players within the larger economic system, they are part of the problem, rather than the solution. For example, worthy palliatives and incremental changes, such as electric cars and biofuels will not save us. We need to re-think design from scratch..."

We argue that traditional design methods are insufficient for dealing with 'messes' due to overwhelming complexity and emergent effects. {{argument better}}

In this research we attempt to define the properties of 'messes', and how our approaches to these issues could be improved.

- design is intentional, 'messes' arrise non-intentionally
  - {{talk about unintentional side-effects}}
- design is about framing, 'messes' are scopeless
  - {{talk about how project scope is the root of all evil}}
  - design is situated 'messes' are ambient
  - design is economical, 'messes' are ecological
- 'messes' are epistemological multiplicities [6]
  - {{talk about nils bohrs complementarity principle}}

Both design thinking and systems thinking have a tradition of mapping the problem space. Design has it's more informal processes of context-mapping and ... . and, more recently the proposal for GIGA-mapping [7]
Similarly Systems thinking has long relied on a more formal approach and diagrammatic notation systems. On top of that, systems dynamics has develope sybolic notations (i.e. programming languages suh as dynamo in order to run computer simulations. [8]

The design methods movement has a parelell with so-called hypertext systems. Allready Rittel, in his proposal of IBIS as an aproach to wicked problems developed hypertext tools as a way of augmenting tedious pen-and paper processes [9]. Similarly, Alexander's "a pattern language" has internal references, and could be said to have the structure of a hypertext document.[10] This later inspired the creation of the first wiki(source). Hypertext pioneers such as Ted Nelson described the structure of knowledge as being 'intertwingular', mirroring the structure of 'messes'. [11]
Douglas Engelbart developed his NLS (oNLine System), as a "strategy and means for coping with complex problems" [12]
Most of these pioneers argue that, allthough computers have now become commonplace, their power as "tools for thinking" remains underutilised. (sources)

In this light, we attempt to define a collaborative, computational hyper-mapping environment.
