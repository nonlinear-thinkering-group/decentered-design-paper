# hypermapping the global mess

Although the super wicked problem of climate change has increasingly gained attention as one of the most important issues of this generation, it is not at all an isolated issue. Climate change is surrounded by many interrelated problems including, but not limited to: planetary overshoot, mass extinction, poverty, migration, resource depletion and the antibiotic resistance crisis. The concept of a “mess” (Russel 1974) describes such a system of interrelated problems, where solutions to most problems produce other problems. Following Russel, we call this non-hierarchical system of interrelated wicked problems “the global mess”.

There are different places to intervene in a system (Meadows 1997), some of which are more powerful than others. Policy-makers usually only focus on the least powerful such as subsidies, taxes and standards. While the movement towards environmentally responsible and ecological design offers worthy symptom management and incremental improvements such as electric cars and biofuels, rarely does design thinking intervene at the truly systemic level (Wood 2008). Messes tend to have a *strange loop* structure, where those trying to solve the problem are also causing it (Morton 2016). A solution to a problem in one context, may be causing problems in another. Designers are educated to function within a larger economic system and are mostly concerned with intentional action. However, Mess-like (messy) issues, are unintentional and fall outside of economic boundaries. The occurrence of so called side-effects is dependent on framing. No matter how well we frame a problem, there is always a different place, time, scale or level of abstraction which we keep out of scope. From the messy perspective, unintended side-effects are just effects. This is why we need to re-design design at what Meadows calls the *paradigmatic level*, learning to deal better with complex and messy causal structures, intentional or not. This loopy and self-reflective methodology, known as Metadesign attemts to go beyond User-Centered Design or Participatory Design by attempting to develop the social, technical and economic infrastructures in which new forms of collaborative design can take place. (Fischer & Giaccardi 2004)

Our approach attempts to build on earlier efforts in the Design Methods movement and the development of hypertext systems. Horst Rittel, as an approach to wicked problems, developed hypertext tools as a way to augment issue based information systems (Dubberly). Similarly, Christopher Alexander's “A Pattern Language" has the structure of a hypertext document, which later inspired the idea of the wiki (source). Hypertext pioneer Ted Nelson has described the structure of knowledge as being ‘intertwingular’ (source), mirroring the interconnected, non-hierarchical structure of messes. Douglas Engelbart developed his NLS (oNLine System), as a "strategy and means for coping with complex problems" (source). Most of these pioneers however, argue that while computers, and computer aided design have now become commonplace, their power as "tools for thinking" remains underutilized. (sources)

In this research we attempt to develop socio-technical infrastructures for building a shared understanding of messy situations and the radical re-imagining of them. Both design thinking and systems thinking rely heavily on the notion of mapping. While systems dynamics has it's more formal diagrammatic symbols, designers generally rely on more fuzzy representations. We take these mapping practices and attempt to augment and repourpose them in the computational hypertext domain.

We propose a decentralised and collaborative hypermapping method, that allows a multiplicity of symbolic and diagrammatic representations to exist, transform, merge and grow over time. This systems cartography of some kind,

{{We came to think that we need a general system for creating information structures to work proficiently and with different levels of degree in the complexity of our thinking. We came to realise that a lot of software tries to solve the same problem over and over again: organising information in different (collaborative) structures, transforming that information, and viewing that information in different ways. This abstract description encompasses anything from filesystemes, hypertext, excell, productivity and mind-mapping tools.

This kind of activity is usually done by people called "programmers", but we think anyone should be able to deal with these more abstract structures.}}
