Systems thinking seems to befal a similar fate

Most policy approaches to wicked problems are driving us *away from* what we don't want, rather than *towards* what we do want. [Ackoff]

We argue that traditional analytic approaches to 'problem solving' fail due to overwhelming complexity and emergent effects. It seems to us that we are ill-equiped, both conceptually and practically, to deal with this meta-problem, if it can even be characterised as such.

Our research can be seen as an attempt to "design design", or metadesign.

* Firstly, we attempt to define a new decentered form of collaborative design.
* Secondly, we attempt to design the technical, social (and economic?) infrastructures which will enable such a form of design to emerge.

Designers have long used different forams of "mapping" in order to get a sense of a problem.

Equally, Systems thinking has it's own, more formal diagrammatic representations.
{{During the late 1950s and early 1960s, Forrester and a team of graduate students moved the emerging field of system dynamics from the hand-simulation stage to the formal computer modeling stage. Richard Bennett created the first system dynamics computer modeling language called SIMPLE (Simulation of Industrial Management Problems with Lots of Equations) in the spring of 1958. In 1959, Phyllis Fox and Alexander Pugh wrote the first version of DYNAMO (DYNAmic MOdels), an improved version of SIMPLE, and the system dynamics language became the industry standard for over thirty years. Forrester published the first, and still classic, book in the field titled Industrial Dynamics in 1961}}

These methods are rarely used congrously though,


# Techno-social infrastructures

Rittel, in his discussion of wicked problems proposes a design method known as issue-based information system (IBIS) for handling wicked problems. An approach which he proposed be augmented with a hypertext system.

The history of hypertext is complicated, and we argue that current systems only support "weak" versions of hypertext.

We position our research in line with what one could call the "tools for thinking tradition" which includes among others, douglas engelbart and ted nelson.

Traditional approaches to visualizing complexity quickly devolve into either oversimplification, or what could be called "hairy ball of mud" visualizations, which do not provide any further insight.

We propose a multi-modal system which supports many types of congruous symbolic and diagrammatic representations of systems from many perspectives.

We propose a stigmergetic [^ <https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigmergy>] collaborative model, similar to open-source projects, or wikipedia. Which allows people to collaborate even though they might not be otherwise be inclined to do so due to economic reasons or traditional project scope.

{{ Furthermore, the articles published in our usual journals should be required to answer the “so what” question at the end of each submission. The answer to this question should be an explicit statement of how the author intends to affect the behavior or thinking of the reader. No article should be published without such an appendage. }}{{ what’s this? }}
