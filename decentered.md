# De-centered design

Designers should be commissioned to work at a higher level of engagement. Paradigm change requires radical thinking.

Responsible design, cradle to cradle, human centered design. Similar sentiments emerged in the ‘Creative Commons’ and ‘Open Design’ movements that offer new potential for social integration, and other benefits.


Design has always been a matter of perspective. This perhaps explains the popularity of the "..-centered design" naming scheme. Since the initial proposal of the term "user-centered design" [^ <https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-centered_design>] by norman, and the subsequent emergence of "human-centered design" [^ <https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-centered_design>] there has been {{ IDEO? }}  and ..., to name a few. Particularly the notion of human-centered design, with it's positivist humanism, although extremely popular, is obviously "anthropocentric" in it's thinking. Super wicked problems will require us to deal with the fact that there are many types of subjectivity, some of which may be non-human [^ <https://tuinvanmachines.hetnieuweinstituut.nl/en/stack-and-posthuman-user-interview-benjamin-bratton>]. This is why we propose a shift away from any kind of "centrism", towards what we call decentered design.

The main properties of super wicked problems are:

* Time is running out
* No central authority.
* Those seeking to solve super wicked problems are also causing it. For example the people who advocate for reduced carbon emission, still emit carbon themselves. The causal chain is complex and situated at different levels of scale, within different types of system.
* Policies discount the future rationality

This is why:

* Decentered design requires what one could call "Ambient Perspective". Not top-down, nor bottom up. But distributed like a rhizome.

* Decentered design requires us to stop "object oriented" ways of modeling in favour of "subject orientedness”. {{ could not find any ref }}

* Decentered design requires us to stop Systems & Components ways of modeling in favour of Wholes & Holons [^ <https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holon_(philosophy)>].

* Decentered design breaks down the notion of "project-scope", and the notion of "side-effects".

* Decentered design operates on many levels of scale, time, and complexity. {{ i remember of a reference for this, will look it up }}

* Emergent properties, system boundries
