# The mess: being and design (and time)

http://www.rawshaping.com/

## Introduction

* We are work and are interested in the hybrid space between design/programming/ecology/mathematics/architecture/governance etc.
* This talk is very multi-disciplinary in that sense, it tries to talk about abstractions

* piaget
* mental models, schema
* sun and animism
*

We focus on:
* non-linear thinking
* tools for non-linear thinking

* story about overshoot & poverty

* climate change & many other problems

* The mess

* While designers are problem solvers,

* Human centered design

* The mess a simulacrum
    * piagetian conservation test
    * mental models of other people
    * embedded cognition, extended cognition
    * non-linear systems, computer simulations

* The mess is a strange loop
    *

* The mess is it's own context
* The mess is ambient



Although the super wicked problem of climate change has increasingly gained attention as one of the most important issues of this generation, it is not at all an isolated issue. Climate change is surrounded by many interrelated problems including, but not limited to: planetary overshoot, mass extinction, poverty, migration, resource depletion and the antibiotic resistance crisis.

I bring all of this up, not to make you wallow in dispair, nor to make you feel depressed or hopeless. Designers are afterall an optimistic bunch, we're problem solvers, we think in terms of solutions, not problems. But we are designers in the age of the Anthropocene. A geological epoch in which the most significant force impacting the Earth's geology and ecosystems is humans. Not volcanoes, or rivers, but humans. Unless you live under a rock, you have undoubtedly heard this by now. But of course, we al do, in fact live under a rock, allbeit in the form of a house. And this is exactly the point.

I have recently started thinking of this situation in terms of a concept I call "the global mess". A "mess" is non-hierarchical system of interrelated problems and solutions, where solutions to most problems produce other problems, and weirdly, some problems are, in fact, solutions to other problems. In this talk, I hope to convince you that there is such a thing as "the global mess", and also, hope to offer you some insight into how this mess actually works, and what we as designers could be doing about it. This is not an easy task, if not only because of the vast intertwingled nature this of the topic. And to be honest I´ll most probably fail, but I think it's worth trying none the less.

I've cut up this talk in a few different sections. I'll try to make clear what I'm talking about, by flying over it, in multiple passes, like pictures taken by satelites flying in different orbital paths, pictures which then get be stitched together into a larger picture, a somewhat coherent whole.

### The ontological multiple (or a thing about things)

* you are looking at me talking to you
* you are looking at an image of me, on a screen, talking to you
* you are looking at an array of led-lights, pulsing and flickering in a pattern that to your mind, roughly represents, and is understood as being me talking to you
* you are looking at light which has departed about eight minutes earlier from the sun, has been reflected and refracted by the atmosphere, the windows, my environment, on my skin, my clothes, creating an ambient field of energy all around me, which when it finally hits the camera's sensors gets interpreted as differences in energetic state, out of which information can be gleaned about my form, my colors, my movements.
* you are looking at information captured by a camera, encoded into binary electric pulses, transferred through radio/wifi signals, along cables, sent through a complex network of data-centres, and relay points spread accross earth, finally arriving at your location, and being decoded again into patterns that can be understood by a screen.
* you are looking at that information, in electronic form, being manipulated and transformed by thousands of transistors and other electronic components, constantly in flux, electrons jumping and zipping around a circuit.
* you are looking at bits, flipping back and forth between zero and one, at a speed of roughly 3 billion times a second.
* you are looking at instructions, being read from a random acces memory into a central procesing unit, carefully and precicely orchestrating these fluctuations, shifting, moving, multiplying and adding bits in neatly packeged in 64-bit groups.
* you are looking at a computer program, reading and writing bytes, numbers, letters and sentences, building complex algorithmic structures, trees and graphs, representing colours which draw shapes on a screen
* you are looking at a browser, a computer program, reading, parsing and interpreting other computer programs and protocols, HTTP, TCP/IP, HTML, CSS, Javascript, translating them into lower levels of computer programs, constantly building and breaking down levels of abstraction, like towers constantly rising and falling.
* you are looking at a computer, designed by vast amounts of engineers and designers and programmers,
* you are looking at a machine, assembled by in part by machines, in part by humans, most probably women, most probably chinese. The average woman electronic equipment assembler in China, according to the database of the International Labour Organization, earns about $100 per month.
* you are looking at a pile of rare-earth minerals, plastics and other synthetic and organic materials, pulled out of the earth by machines, or sometimes by bare-human hands,
* you are looking at this primal-goo, stones and rocks, having been refined into pure materials, assembled by a vast world-wide system of economic transactions into the complex, and highly unlikly configuration of components and parts that sits in front of you
* you are looking at me, a highly complex assemblage of organs, cells, bacteria and microbes, networks of chemical reactions, collaborating together, synergetically, as what we call a human being.
* you are looking at me, talking to you, through all of this, and yet we barely even notice

As designers, we design things, objects which we can hold in our hands and manipulate. Perhaps we are interaction designers, designing interactions between humans and things. But what I'm trying to say here, is that things, however thinglike they may seem, they are in fact not just "things". Objects, things, and humans, other species are deeply entangled in a complex network of causality.

What is the function of a screwdriver? Now what is the function of a screwdriver in outerspace?
The function of a screwdriver is completely dependant on it's context. A function lies, as it were, between an object and it's context. Similarly, whenever you don't have a screwdriver at hand, you could just use a knife. It doesn't really matter what the designers *intention* with the object was. It just so happens that the knife and a screw fit together. The ecological psychologist James J. Gibson has a word for this effect. He calls it "affordance". Affordance, according to Gibson, is about the structural and chemical properties that involve relationships between elements in the environment, some of which happen to be human beings. Separating what a structure affords, from the effect on the perceivers self-interest helps us to understand that not all situations are the same from one perciever to the next. What a designer perceives is not what a user may perceive. You've probably heard of the term affordance before, as it was later adapted by Donald Norman, as a way of understanding what he called "user centered design". Broadly, UCD is about engagement with the needs, desires and shortcomings of the user and explores design from the analysis and insight into what the User might need or want to do. It moves the center from the designer’s mental model of the system to the designer’s mental model of the user of the system.

Without UCD, Amazon couldn’t have put bookstores out of business, “ride-hailing” services couldn’t have broken the taxi industries in cities where they roll out, and digital music would never have broken the historical pricing and distribution practices of the record labels. Designers are appropriately proud of their roles in these disruptions; their insights into user desire and behavior are what made them possible.

But as designers construct these systems, what of the systems that interact with those systems? What about systems of local commerce and the civic engagement? Or the systems of unions that emerged after generations of labor struggles? Or the systems that provided compensation for some reasonable number of artists? When designers center around the user, where do the needs and desires of the other actors in the system go? The lens of the user obscures the view of the ecosystems it affects.

That is, when we design an object, we aren't just desiging an object, nor can we just design any object, we are dependant on the ambient environment of available technologies, material streams, ecologies, social structures, economies, architectures. We are deeply entangled with a multitude of complex adaptive systems.

    * Affordance
    * Ad-hocism
    * Structural-coupling (any niche will be filled)

    * Problemics (problems and solutions are the same)
        * Arctic cable
        * Climate resistant wheat?

* the speculative turn

* Nobody decided to warm up the planet, yet it happened anyway, descisions were made, design was done.

### The mess is a simulacrum

* Perception, affect, representation
    * Schema?
* Embedded & Extended cognition
* We understand climate change only through simulations (i.e. extended cognition)
* It's really *there* but we can only *know* it through simulation
    * unlike linear equations, non-linear systems are very difficult to solve *analyticaly*. And demand the use of numerical simulations, *computations* carried out with the help of machines.
    * We only have one shot in reality

* Global problems can't be fixed at the local scale only
* Less, Eames levels of 10 more interlinking patterns and leaky abstractions
* Holonic systems are created out of differential processes
* Computers and Cat's have a different type of architecture
    * (if you try to take a cat apart, to see how it works, the first thing you have is a non-working cat)
* Gall's law
* Cities, Species, Habitats, Weather systems


### The mess is strange

* It loops back on itself
* If we were to build a computer that could perfectly model climate change it would itself be the single most significant energy consumption event that it itself would be modeling. (the stack)
* Identity
* Ant circle of death


### Ambient perspective

* renessance, one-point perspective
* isometric perspective in architecture and design
    * Axonometry was crucial in the development of the Chinese hand scroll painting, an art form that art historian George Rowley referred to as “the supreme creation of Chinese genius.” Classic hand scroll paintings were up to ten meters in length. They are viewed by unrolling them from right to left in equal segments of about 50 cm. The painting takes the viewer through a visual story in space and time.

    A scroll may depict life along a river. We unroll the opening sequence of the scroll and see people boarding a boat on a river. As we unroll the scroll further from right to left, we see the boat cross a lake, navigate rapids in the river, stop at a small harbor, and lastly arrive at its destination at the sea shore. We have traveled through the landscape (space) in the course of the day (time).

    Importantly, the scroll is not a sequence of separate scenes. It is a continuous, seamless image. This explains the importance of axonometry. When a building comes into view, it is depicted in axonometric projection. Linear perspective, which assumes a fixed position of the viewer, could not be used in the pictorial scroll format. With axonometry, which lacks a vanishing point, the focus is everywhere and nowhere.

    Jesuit missionaries based in China brought illustrations of axonometry back to Europe in the 17th century. The exotic graphic device was initially used for diamond cutting, ballistic measurements and other technical measurements. Its wider acceptance came in the 19th century, when English scientist William Farish, using Euclidean geometry, developed isometry. It gave axonometry a mathematical foundation.

    Farish published a paper entitled ‘On Isometrical Perspective’ in which he made clear the Industrial Revolution needed technical working drawings free of optical distortion.

* cubism (multiple perspective in time)

    Metzinger and Gleizes explicitly related the sense of time to multiple perspective, giving symbolic expression to the notion of ‘duration’ proposed by the philosopher Henri Bergson according to which life is subjectively experienced as a continuum, with the past flowing into the present and the present merging into the future. The Salon Cubists used the faceted treatment of solid and space and effects of multiple viewpoints to convey a physical and psychological sense of the fluidity of consciousness, blurring the distinctions between past, present and future. One of the major theoretical innovations made by the Salon Cubists, independently of Picasso and Braque, was that of simultaneity,[4] drawing to greater or lesser extent on theories of Henri Poincaré, Ernst Mach, Charles Henry, Maurice Princet, and Henri Bergson. With simultaneity, the concept of separate spatial and temporal dimensions was comprehensively challenged. Linear perspective developed during the Renaissance was vacated. The subject matter was no longer considered from a specific point of view at a moment in time, but built following a selection of successive viewpoints, i.e., as if viewed simultaneously from numerous angles (and in multiple dimensions) with the eye free to roam from one to the other.
