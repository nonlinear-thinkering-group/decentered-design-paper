design as meaning (schema & self-identity)
design as cybernetics (strange loops & non-linear systems)
design as ecology (function, stigmergy, affordance, hyperobjects, assemblages)
design as metadesign (the mess )

# The mess: being and design (and time)

http://www.rawshaping.com/

## Introduction

* We are work and are interested in the hybrid space between design/programming/ecology/mathematics/architecture/governance etc.
* This talk is very multi-disciplinary in that sense, it tries to talk about abstractions

### The computer multiple

* you are looking at me talking to you
* you are looking at an image of me, on a screen, talking to you
* you are looking at an array of led-lights, pulsing and flickering in a pattern that to your mind, roughly represents, and is understood as being me talking to you
* you are looking at light which has departed roughly eight minuits earlier from the sun, has been reflected and refracted by the atmosphere, the windows, my environment, on my skin, my clothes, creating an ambient field of energy all around me, which when it finally hits the camera's sensors gets interpreted as differences in energetic state, out of which information can be gleaned about my form, my colors, my movements etc.
* you are looking at information captured by a camera, encoded into binary electric pulses, transferred along cables, sent through a complex network of data-centres and relay points spread accross earth, finally arriving at your location, and being decoded again into patterns that can be understood by a screen.
* you are looking at that information, in electronic form, being manipulated and transformed by thousands of transistors and other electronic components, constantly in flux, electrons jumping and zipping around a circuit.
* you are looking at bits, flipping back and forth between zero and one, at a speed of roughly 3 billion times a second.
* you are looking at instructions, being read from a random acces memory into a central procesing unit, carefully and precicely orchestrating these fluctuations, shifting, moving, multiplying and adding 64-bit packages.
* you are looking at a computer program, reading and writing bytes, numbers, letters and sentences, complex algorithmic structures, trees and graphs, representing colours which draw shapes on a screen, managing connections to other programs, through an internet connection.
* you are looking at a browser, a computer program, interpreting other computer programs and protocols, HTTP, TCP/IP, HTML, CSS, Javascript, translating them into lower levels of computer programs, constantly building and breaking down levels of abstaction.
* you are looking at a pile of rare-earth minerals, plastics and other synthetic and organic materials, pulled out of the earth by machines, or sometimes by bare-human hands,
* you are looking at this primal-goo, stones and rocks, having been refined into pure materials, assembled by a world-wide economic system into the complex, and highly unlikly configuration of components and parts that sits in front of you
* you are looking at a computer, designed by vast amounts of engineers and designers and programmers,
* you are looking at a machine, assembled by in part by machines, in part by humans, most probably women, most probably chinese. The average woman electronic equipment assembler in China, according to the database of the International Labour Organization, earns about $100 per month.
* you are looking at me, a highly complex assemblage of organs, cells, bacteria and microbes, networks of chemical reactions, collaborating together, synergetically, as what we call a human being.
* you are looking at me, talking to you, through all of this


## the mess

* An introduction of "the mess" as a schema of understanding

### The mess is a simulacrum

* Perception, affect, representation
    * Schema?
* Embedded & Extended cognition
* We understand climate change only through simulations (i.e. extended cognition)
* It's really *there* but we can only *know* it through simulation
    * unlike linear equations, non-linear systems are very difficult to solve *analyticaly*. And demand the use of numerical simulations, *computations* carried out with the help of machines.
    * We only have one shot in reality


### The mess is strange

* It loops back on itself
* If we were to build a computer that could perfectly model climate change it would itself be the single most significant energy consumption event that it itself would be modeling. (the stack)
* Identity
* Ant circle of death

### The mess is both function and context

* What is the function of a screwdrivier?
    * Context dependance
    * Affordance
    * Ad-hocism
    * Structural-coupling (any niche will be filled)
    * Problemics (problems and solutions are the same)
        * Arctic cable
        * Climate resistant wheat?


### The mess is unintentional

* Nobody decided to warm up the planet, yet it happened anyway, descisions were made, design was done.

### The mess is ambient

* ambient perspective
    * renessance, one-point perspective
    * isometric perspective in architecture and design
    * cubism (multiple perspective in time)
    * Newtonian and Leibnizian Spaces

    * the speculative turn
    * deep time
        * different experience of time
            * GPS systems
        * how do we create empathy for beings in deep-time?
            * Onkalo spent nuclear fuel repository

### The mess is holonic

* Global problems can't be fixed at the local scale only
* Less, Eames levels of 10 more interlinking patterns and leaky abstractions
* Holonic systems are created out of differential processes
* Computers and Cat's have a different type of architecture
    * (if you try to take a cat apart, to see how it works, the first thing you have is a non-working cat)
* Gall's law
* Cities, Species, Habitats, Weather systems
