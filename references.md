# Metadesign
Regarding a wide range of applications and contexts, Vass√£o has argued that Metadesign can be understood as a set of four "conceptual tools", utilizing Gilles Deleuze's understanding of the term "tool":

    - Levels of abstraction (the ability to understand the structure and limits of abstractions, language and instrumental thinking);
    - Diagrams and topology (the use of diagrammatic thinking and design, sustained by topological understanding);
    - Procedural design (the creation of realities through the use of procedures, such as in game and role playing, as well as in procedural design, art and architecture);
    - Emergence (the absence of absolute control, and the ability to take advantage of unintended and unforeseen results).
